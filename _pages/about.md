I'm a first year PhD student from [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I earned my Bachelor of Science from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University (北京大学)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in July 2025.

My research interest is algebraic combinatorics with a focus on combinatorial representation theory, orbit harmonics, symmetric functions, and Schubert calculus. Now I'm advised by [Professor Brendon Rhoades](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~bprhoades/) at UCSD. During my undergraduate life at PKU, I was advised by [Professor Yibo Gao](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~gaoyibo/).

I love Nijigen, especially anime! My favorite anime is [Yuki Yuna is a hero (結城友奈は勇者である) (结城友奈是勇者)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Yuna_Is_a_Hero), and [Minowa Gin (三ノ輪銀) (三之轮银)](https://yuyuyu.fandom.com/wiki/Minowa_Gin) is the hero I admire the most. I travelled around Japan for [pilgrimage to sacred places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seichi_junrei) after attending [FPSAC2025](https://www.math.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/fpsac2025/). Here are some [pictures](../images) I took.

I also like SanShou (散打) and Taekwondo.
