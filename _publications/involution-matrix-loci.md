excerpt: 'Let $$\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C})$$ be the affine space of $$n \times n$$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $$\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$$. We define graded quotients of $$\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times n}]$$ which carry an action of the symmetric group $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$ by simultaneous permutation of rows and columns. These quotient rings are obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all involutions in $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$ and the conjugacy classes of involutions in $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$ with a given number of fixed points. In the case of perfect matchings on $$\{1, \dots, n\}$$ with $$n$$ even, the Hilbert series of our quotient ring is related to Tracy-Widom distributions and its graded Frobenius image gives a refinement of the plethysm $$h_{n/2}[h_2]$$.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
