excerpt: 'Let $$\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$$ be the set consisting of involutions in the symmetric group $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$ with exactly $$a$$ fixed points, and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$-module $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $$\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$$ of $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $$\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$$. As an application, we deduce a series of $$\mathfrak{S}_n$$-equivariant isomorphisms between graded components $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})_d$$ and $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a^\prime})_d$$ for some integers $$a\neq a^\prime$$ and $$d$$. Our positive formulae also yield potential attempts to find a linear basis for $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$$ and a statistic $$\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$$ to interpret the Hilbert series $$\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$$ of $$R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$$.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$$$E=mc^2$$$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$$$...$$$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$$...$$` that is typically expected.
